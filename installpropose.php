                <p>In the fall of 2016, one of the projects in my digital foundations art class (an introductory course needed to pursue my graphic design certificate) was to create a proposal for an art exhibit in a real-world gallery space. The assignment was called <i>Install / Propose</i> and the learning objectives were to think creatively to come up with an interesting art installation, demonstrate competency with 3D modeling software to create images of your plan, and to use writing and design skills to bring everything together into one comprehensive proposal.</p>

                <p>I used <a href="http://www.sketchup.com" target="_blank">SketchUp</a> to build my 3D design and Adobe Illustrator to create an aerial "plan view" of my proposal. I chose to center my proposed art exhibit around an intersection that is very important to me: that of design and engineering, specifically in how they relate to web development. I find immense satisfaction in reconciling these two activities and continually seek to understand how they work together to create a rich web experience.</p>
