                <p>Enrich, Excel, Achieve Learning Academy is a charter school in my hometown of Wausau, Wisconsin that provides middle and high school youth an alternative to the traditional school setting. In the fall of 2015 they decided to rebrand with a new logo and asked students to submit sketches of potential ideas. I was tasked with turning the students’ rough drafts into finalized digital products that the school could pick from.</p>
                <h2>Tree Design</h2>
                    <p>This tree logo was inspired by a vision of growth and nurture – the idea that EEA Charter School is “growing the next generation”. This is the logo idea that was chosen to represent the school, and after the initial decision was made I did some follow-up work to clean the design and adjust it to meet more specific criteria, such as including the school's colors.</p>

                <h2>Graduation Cap Design</h2>
                    <p>This particular logo focuses on the idea that EEA helps students draw their own futures; the EEA pencil is crafting an iconic image of a graduation cap.</p>
