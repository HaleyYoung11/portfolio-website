                <p>The Madison Advertising Club is an organization that connects undergraduate students with professionals in the advertising field. In the spring of 2016 their website was outdated and had been constructed with largely invalid code, and I became inspired one night to create this more polished version. It was my first official web design/development project after deciding to pursue this field as a career.</p>
                <p>I built it in one evening as an unsolicited redesign and simply valued the experience. Upon sending it to the executive board for opinions, I was told it could be used as their live design for a short time until a club veteran finished the update he had already been working on.</p>
