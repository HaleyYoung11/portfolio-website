                            <p class="no-mobile">In my time as part of Mount Olive Lutheran Church's youth group I participated in five out of state mission trips where we traveled to communities in need and served through both physical labor and relational ministry. Specific tasks included but were not limited to working with the disabled, elderly and young, constructing wheelchair ramps, performing home repairs, roofing, painting, and listening openly to those we were serving. In addition, I also served as both a small and large group devotion leader, leading discussions with my peers and collaborating with church staff to create and innovate discussion activities and topics.</p>
