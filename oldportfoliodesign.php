            <p>This is the design I had originally created for my portfolio website: a simple one-page layout divided into three primary sections.</p>
            <p>I drew inspiration from various modern sites around the web as well as one of my favorite pictures of myself (a photo that made it into the renewed design, as you might have noticed on the current homepage).</p>
            <img src="/img/oldportfolio/InitialPortfolioModal.jpg" alt="A screenshot of how the modal part of this design appeared on a desktop and mobile phone">
            <p>I used a purely <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> pop-up modal to highlight my portfolio projects but soon realized it was a nightmare for accessibility and code validation, even though it seemed cool at first. As I learned more about best practices I felt prompted to redesign my internet home, but I wanted to keep this initial design as an example of my work and willingness to keep improving.</p>
